A cscope frontend supporting
o Multiple queries
   It uses a buffer for listing the results of cscope queries.
o Multiple tag stacks
   Supports multiple tag stacks for serious code analyzis.
   The stacks are shown in a buffer.
More information (e.g. usage) can be found at the beginning of the script file.
It uses its own tag stack and not the one that vim has built in. It means that
if you use both vim's ctags support and this script in parallel the two tag stacks
will not interfere.
